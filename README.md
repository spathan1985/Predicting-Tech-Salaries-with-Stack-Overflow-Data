# Predicting-Tech-Salaries-with-Stack-Overflow-Data
Using Machine Learning models to predict tech salaries using data from the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

With over 80,000 global developer responses, this real-world dataset includes variables like experience, education, role, and more. We'll explore how to clean a large dataset, engineer features, avoid data leakage, and train a regression model that can predict salary ranges.
